# Python_Scripts
This repository contains Python scripts written by Muhammad Ali Hashmi
This script is written in Python v3 which can read a Gaussian or ORCA output files and extract the optimized structure out of that file.
The Cartesian coordinates of the optimized structure can be exported to an xyz file, a new Gaussian input file, or an ORCA input file.
