# Python_Scripts
This repository contains Python scripts written by Muhammad Ali Hashmi.
These scripts are written in Python v3 which can perform various functions as stated in their respective readme files.
Most of these scripts are for the researchers of Computational Chemistry and deal with different tasks with Gaussian or ORCA files.
